# skymap-overlap

Compute the overlap between two skymaps

## Requirements
 * Python2.7/Python3.X
 * emcee==2.2.1
 * scipy-stack (numpy, scipy, matplotlib, pandas)
 * astropy
 * healpy
 * lal
 * ligo-gracedb (for batch downloading skymaps)
 * corner (for generating corner plots)
 * gstlal (for generating dag files)*

*If you are using LDG head-nodes, the gstlal installed system-wide will work just fine

## Installation
Simply git clone this repository. Add ${INSTALLATION_PATH}/skymap-overlap/ to the environment variable ${PATH}.

## Usage
### Computing the pairwise overlap between a batch of skymaps
To compute the pairwise overlap between a batch of skymaps, you can use `compute_overlap_from_skymaps_pipe` which generates a DAG file
for you to submit to a HTCondor-compatible cluster to draw (RA, DEC) samples from the probability skymaps and then calculate the overlap.
The simplest usage is
```
compute_overlap_from_skymaps_pipe --skymap SKYMAP1.fits.gz --skymap SKYMAP2.fits.gz --skymap SKYMAP3.fits.gz
```
so on and so forth. There are also other options for example the accounting tag (if you are running on LDG), and the number of samples
you want to draw using MCMC sampling.

### Computing the overlap between two skymaps
To compute the overlap between two skymaps, one can use `compute_overlap` to compute the overlap
given the samples drawn from the two skymaps (e.g. from `ra_dec_samples_from_skymap`). The simplest usage is
```
compute_overlap --posterior_samples SAMPLES_FROM_SKYMAP1.dat --posterior_samples SAMPLES_FROM_SKYMAP2.dat
```

### Drawing (RA, DEC) samples from a probability skymap
To draw samples of the right ascension (RA) and declination (DEC) from a probability skymap (in a fits file), one can use
`ra_dec_samples_from_skymap` which uses the PTMCMC sampling algorithm in `emcee` to draw samples. The simplest usage is
```
ra_dec_samples_from_skymap --skymap SKYMAP.fits.gz
```
It is output a tab-delimited text file containing the drawn samples.

### Batch downloading skymaps from GraceDB
You can use `download_skymap` to download skymaps from GraceDB given the GID or SID. The simplest usage is
```
download_skymap GID_or_SID
```
By default it will download LALInference skymaps whenever possible. There is also an option `--bayestar` to only use
skymaps generated by bayestar.
